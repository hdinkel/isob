The isobarQuant package processes data from
.raw files acquired on Thermo Scientific Orbitrap / QExactive
instrumentation working in  HCD / HCD or CID / HCD fragmentation modes.
It creates an .hdf5 file into which are later parsed the results from
Mascot searches. From these files protein groups are inferred and quantified.

This file is the protein container for Mascot protein information.
This holds the peptide data associated with the protein.
