"""This module is part of the isobarQuant package,
written by Toby Mathieson and Gavain Sweetman
(c) 2016 Cellzome GmbH, a GSK Company, Meyerhofstrasse 1,
69117, Heidelberg, Germany.

The isobarQuant package processes data from
.raw files acquired on Thermo Scientific Orbitrap / QExactive / Fusion
instrumentation working in  HCD / HCD or CID / HCD fragmentation modes.
It creates an .hdf5 file into which are later parsed the results from
Mascot searches. From these files protein groups are inferred and quantified.

This small script simply extracts the gene names and descriptions from
Uniprot .fasta files, writing them to a file called essentialuniprotdata.txt in
the current directory.

The first command line argument is the location of the .fasta file.
